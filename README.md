### React Meteor Todo List App


Welcome to my React Meteor Todo List App! This project represents my journey in building a feature-rich task management application using the Meteor framework and React library. Throughout the development process, I implemented a series of essential features, each building upon the previous one. Below, you'll find an overview of the main functionalities I added to this application, following a structured development path:

1. Create the App: The initial step involved setting up the basic project structure, ensuring that Meteor and React were integrated correctly.

2. Collections: I established data collections to store and manage tasks efficiently.

3. Forms and Events: Forms were implemented for adding and editing tasks, and event handling was set up to manage user interactions seamlessly.

4. Update and Remove: Users can update and remove tasks, allowing for easy task management.

5. Styles: To enhance the user experience, I added styles and layout improvements to make the app visually appealing.

6. Filter Tasks: Implemented the ability to filter tasks based on various criteria, making it easier for users to find and manage their tasks.

7. Adding User Accounts: Users can now create their accounts and personalize their task lists.

8. Login with GitHub: As a convenience feature, I integrated GitHub authentication for seamless login and account management.

9. Methods: Utilizing Meteor methods, I ensured secure communication between the client and server for critical operations.

10. Publications: Finally, I set up publications to control the data that is exposed to the client, ensuring data security and efficiency.
